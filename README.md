# Playroom - portfolio/personal website
See live [Tess' Playroom](https://tessrezard.github.io/playroom/) site at [tessrezard.github.io/playroom/](https://tessrezard.github.io/playroom/)\

This is a portfolio/personal website, using traditional technologies (no react). </br>
The 'rainbow' stars at the top of the page were my first real foray into Javascript, and I'm still pleased with the effect.

I created this website before I had experience with react, and I would ultimately like to rebuild it in react.
